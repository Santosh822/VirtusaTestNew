### Get Best Stories

Retrieves the best n stories from the Hacker News API, sorted by score.

- **URL:** `/api/stories?n={number}`

- **Method:** `GET`

- **Parameters:**
  - `n` (required): The number of stories to retrieve.

  - `title`: The title of the story.
  - `uri`: The URL of the story.
  - `postedBy`: The user who posted the story.
  - `time`: The timestamp when the story was posted.

## Assumptions

- The Hacker News API is accessible.
- Error handling and validation are minimal in this sample. You should enhance error handling for production use.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement caching to reduce the number of requests to the Hacker News API.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent overloading the Hacker News API.
- Add more robust error handling and validation.
- Create a production-ready deployment strategy (e.g., Docker, Azure, AWS).
